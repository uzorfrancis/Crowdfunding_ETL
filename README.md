# Crowdfunding_ETL
The purpose of this project was to build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and Pandas to transform crowdfunding data from Excel files. Four different CSV files were created and then used to generate an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) and Table Schema. This information was then extracted and loaded into a Postgres database to analyze the data and get insight information.
